### **Elevate Your Game to the Next Level. Automatically.**

**Chess From Zero** is not just a chess bot. It's an intelligent, Python-based assistant designed to be your sparring partner, analysis tool, and right hand on Chess.com. Powered by the **Stockfish** engine and sophisticated browser automation, this bot is engineered to play with a remarkably human-like style, allowing you to explore new strategies and dominate the game while staying under the radar.

---

## ✨ Key Features

*   **♟️ Hyper-Realistic Playstyle:** Forget rigid bots. With **Dynamic Depth & Nodes**, **Blunder Logic**, and **Advanced Time Management**, this bot mimics the thought process, inconsistencies, and even the subtle mistakes of a human player, making it nearly indistinguishable from a real person.

*   **📚 Dynamic Opening Book:** Never play the same opening twice. Simply drop your Polyglot (`.bin`) opening book files into the `opening_books` directory, and the bot will automatically detect and randomly choose one for each game.

*   **⚙️ Full Control at Your Fingertips:** Every engine parameter, from the **target Elo** to the level of "aggressiveness" (`Contempt`), is easily configurable through a single, well-documented `config.ini` file. You are the coach.

*   **🕹️ Full Automation:** Enable `auto_play` and let the bot handle game after game, complete with configurable, mode-dependent delays between matches to simulate a human taking a break.

*   **👻 Stealth Mode:** Run the bot in `headless` mode to hide the browser window, allowing you to focus on other tasks while the bot works in the background.
